<p>When creating a new application within IBM Worklight Studio, the developer is given a choice of configuring three javascript libraries: jQuerymobile, Dojo, Sencha Touch. In recent times, my job as an IT Architect supporting mobile development projects has given me the opportunity to come across several Business Partners interested in using Angular as their framework for developing hybrid applications.
<p></p>Without doubt, the use of Angular has its advantages and, if implemented correctly, the resulting application can take full benefit of the IBM Worklight Foundation services. Application security and fast integration with back-end systems stand out among those benefits. Moreover, but the platform delivers added value in providing an integrated platform that includes a comprehensive development environment, mobile-optimized runtime middleware, a private enterprise application store, and an integrated management and analytics console, all supported by various security mechanisms. 
<p></p>On the down side, writing an application with Angular and taking full advantages of the benefits of the platform might need a little bit of trial and error before the developer is able to find the correct implementation. <strong>PB.BANK</strong> is a starter hybrid application built on IBM Worklight leveraging the AngularJS framework and IBM Bluemix to host backend services. It is built on the <em>online banking</em> paradigm but its purpose is just to show how several functionalities can be easily achieved by leveraging the tools available. </p>
